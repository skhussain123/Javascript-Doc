# **JavaScript- Control Flow Statements**
Control flow statements in JavaScript control the order in which code is executed. These statements allow you to make decisions, repeat tasks, and jump between parts of a program based on specific conditions.

## **1. Decision-Making Statements**

### **JavaScript if Statement**
The if statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
```bash
const age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
}

outout:
You are an adult.
```

* Checks if age is greater than or equal to 18.
* Logs "You are an adult." if the condition is true.
