## There are various operators supported by JavaScript.
### **1. JavaScript Arithmetic Operators**
Arithmetic Operators perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
```bash
const sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
const diff = 10 - 2; // Subtraction
const p = 4 * 2; // Multiplication
const q = 8 / 2; // Division
console.log(sum, diff, p, q);

output:
8 8 8 4
```

+ adds two numbers.
â€“ subtracts the second number from the first.
* multiplies two numbers.
/ divides the first number by the second.


### **2. JavaScript Assignment Operators**
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform operations like addition or multiplication before assigning the value.
```bash
let n = 10;
n += 5;
n *= 2;
console.log(n);

output:
30
```

= assigns a value to a variable.
+= adds and assigns the result to the variable.
*= multiplies and assigns the result to the variable.
