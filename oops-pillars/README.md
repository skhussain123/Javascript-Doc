| Pillar            | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Hides details using classes and methods.              |
| **Abstraction**   | Shows only necessary features.                        |
| **Inheritance**   | One class can use another class's properties/methods. |
| **Polymorphism**  | One method behaves differently in different classes.  |
