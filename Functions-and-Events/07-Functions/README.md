# **Functions in JavaScript**
Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They allow you to organize, reuse, and modularize code. It can take inputs, perform actions, and return outputs. 
```bash
function sum(x, y) { 
    return x + y; 
}
console.log(sum(6, 9));

output:
15
```

## **Function Syntax and Working**
A function definition is sometimes also termed a function declaration or function statement. Below are the rules for creating a function in JavaScript:

* Begin with the keyword function followed by,
* A user-defined function name (In the above example, the name is sum)
* A list of parameters enclosed within parentheses and separated by commas (In the above example, parameters are x and y)
* A list of statements composing the body of the function enclosed within curly braces {} (In the above example, the statement is “return x + y”).
